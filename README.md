Simon's Python Obfuscator
=========================

Run the code directly at: http://pyobf.herokuapp.com

This open source obfuscator hopes to obfuscate python scripts and make the scripts unreadable, since you can somehow retrieve the source code from de-compiling the Python bytecode.

Currently it can obfuscate most of the single Python script, and it is runnable as long as there is no \\ in quotes (I am still trying to get this to work)

Inspired by one of the most famous Javascript obfuscator, /packer/

Changelog
=========
v0.3: Used base64 to fix the backslash issues! Should be able to obfuscate itself.

v0.2: changed the pack structure, still trying to fix the back slash problem.

v0.1: Basic hack, lots of bugs, cannot even obfuscate itself, or obfuscated code.
